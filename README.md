[![Download Battlefield Admin Control Panel](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bfacp/files/latest/download)

Download the latest version. Once downloaded unzip it to a temporary folder on your computer. Next open the `.env.php` file located in the root folder in your favorite text editor. Scroll down to the database settings section and fill in your database connection information.

```PHP
    /**
     * Database Settings
     */
    'DB_HOST'        => 'localhost',
    'DB_USER'        => 'root',
    'DB_PASS'        => '',
    'DB_NAME'        => 'mydatabase',
```

Next we need to create a encryption key. This is **IMPORTANT**! The default key provided is just a placeholder string and is insecure. I have provided a page where you can get a random 32 character string. I do **NOT** save these and they are random on each refresh. You can access this page [here](https://adkats.gamerethos.net/api/random_key). Once you have your key open up the file `.env.php` in the root folder and scroll down till you see the `APP_KEY` field. Replace the `YourSecretKey!!!` with the key that was generated. By default it will look like this.

```PHP
    /**
     * Set your app key here
     */
    'APP_KEY'        => 'YourSecretKey!!!'
```

Once completed upload the entire application to your webserver. Once uploaded you will need to modify some file and folder permissions. Change the files and folders permissions under `app/storage` recursively to 0777. This application was designed to run on a subdomain and not from a folder from the TLD. Make sure to create a subdomain and if possible have domain point to the public folder that's located under the root folder.

Now load up application in your web browser and it will begin the process of creating the tables. This process will take a few seconds to run on first load. When it completed you should see the dashboard.

## Default login

**Username**: admin

**Password**: password

You can change the default username and password by clicking on **Site Management** > **Users** > **Admin**

If you have any questions or need help setting this up please post it [here](http://www.adkgamers.com/forum/265-adk-web-dev-support/).

Please create a ticket for bugs/requests. [here](https://github.com/Prophet731/BFAdminCP/issues).

## Installing from the command line

This method is only for those who have shell access to their web server or VPS. This will download and extract the files to your current directory. Make sure it's an empty directory.

If you have git installed you can just run the following command to install it. You must have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) and php command line installed.

### Composer Method (preferred)

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist --no-scripts --keep-vcs adkgamers/bfadmincp .
```

### Git Method

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prophet731/BFAdminCP.git .
composer install --no-scripts
```

This will clone and install the dependency's need for the BFACP to work. This will checkout the master branch which is the stable version. If you would like to run the develop version you will need to run `git checkout develop` before you issue the composer command.

To update it all you will need to do is run `git pull` and it will pull the latest version on the current branch (master or develop).

To make this an automated process you can create a cron job for it.

```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/bfacp; git pull >/dev/null 2>&1
```
